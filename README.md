# How to install dependencies

# How to run the app locally

# Any assumptions or decisions made during development
 - assuming that app is build only for assignment purpose and not for any production purpose.
 - we have added api key in the code instead of environment variable.


# bonus feature
auto- suggestion -  it is very simple as need city api to get the list of api, then apply debounce to every onchange handler.

animaiton -  it is also simple as just play with data and css

theme toggle - it is also simple as just need color theme for darka dn light, we already have api to get the user system theme.

mock api. --> use the service worker to play with offline mode and send pre existing or history city with their data.
